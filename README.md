This repository is for personal use for moving Operating System classwork files between machines in the Spring 2024 semester.
the majority of this repository was written and debugged using Ubuntu - this is my first hands-on experience with Linux using C++.
When viable, I opt to use my home PC because it has better performance over my ideapad running on Ubuntu.
